A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

### Headline specifications

* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces.
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
